For Logo:
In the case where i don't want to use the logo from the materials website itself, you can download the picture you want to use, create an "assets" folder in the "docs" folder, download the picture you want to use and put it in the assets folder. The code will change from: 
icon:
     logo: fontawesome/solid/dungeon

to:

logo: assets/logo.png


To change the websites icon, download the picture of the icon you want to use, create a file named favicon.ico in the assets folder, then drag the pucture you want to use into the favicon page you just created
